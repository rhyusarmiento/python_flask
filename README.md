# Python Tutorial For Flask
> This is a tutorial I went through while going through the Bottega course.
## Start the server
- Run the following commands in your terminal while in the `python_flask` folder.
```
$ pipenv shell
(hello_flask) python app.py
```
- If you get an error saying it doesn't know about a package, you might need to install the packages, or you might not be in your `pipenv shell`
```
$ pipenv shell
(hello_flask) pipenv install
(hello_flask) python app.py
